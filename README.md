## Description
Step into The Stereo Project, a VR-ready 3D environment designed for audiophiles and enthusiasts who appreciate speaker placement, room design, and immersive exploration.

Explore the Listening Room
This isn't just a webpageâ€”it's a virtual stereo room, built using A-Frame HTML, where you can:

ðŸ”¹ Move Freely â€“ Pan, tilt, and navigate throughout the space. ðŸ”¹ Click to Interact â€“ Change speaker colors or access directions. ðŸ”¹ VR-Ready â€“ Experience the room in virtual reality for full immersion.

This is my first foray into A-Frame and VR, and I hope you enjoy exploring the space as much as I enjoyed creating it!
No animals were harmed in the making of this project, AI code generation was used to create the code, and no humans were harmed either.
